# Python common

This is common python code that I use between my programs. I also have [common-go](https://github.com/Cyb3r-Jak3/common-go) for common go code.
Documentation is available via [readthedocs](https://common-py.docs.jwhite.network)

To make this smaller there are no requirements but certain functions will require other modules and will raise ModuleNotFoundError if a function is used
